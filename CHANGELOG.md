# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-06-20

### Added
- Neo-tree integration: Added the ability to mark files or all files within a directory directly from Neo-tree using a custom keymap. See `ADVANCED_USAGE.md` for an example configuration.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-06-04

### Added
- New API `mark_the_location_into_a_spetial_list` to programmatically mark locations into a specified list (e.g., for LSP jumps).
- Option `keep_cursor` for the `goto_bookmark` service. When enabled, the cursor returns to its original window after a bookmark action, improving usability for tree view previews.

### Changed
- Tree view preview will now focus an existing preview window if it's already displaying the same bookmark, instead of opening a new one.
- Tree view preview will close any previously open preview window when a different bookmark is previewed.

### Fixed
- Ensured `special_list_id` is correctly used when refreshing the tree after `mark_the_location_into_a_spetial_list` to focus the relevant list.
