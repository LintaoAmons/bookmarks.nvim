- Simple: Add, Rename and Remove bookmarks with only one command, less shortcuts more productivity.
- Persistent: save your bookmarks into a human readable json file, which you can manipulate manually.
- Accessible: Find your bookmark by telescope or Treeview with ease.
- Informative: mark with a description, so you can record more information.
- Visibility: display icon and name at the marked lines, and highlight marked lines.
- Groups: arrange your bookmarks in groups, so keep you away from noises.
- Portable: Easily share your bookmarks across devices or with others by modifying the project path in the JSON file.

## Usage

There's two key concepts in this plugin: `BookmarkList` and `Bookmark`.

You can look into the code to find the structure of those two domain objects.

Also if you want to bind a shortcut to those commands, you can do it by writing some code....

```lua
local function call_bookmark_command()
	local commands = require("bookmarks.adapter.commands").commands
	local command
	for _, c in ipairs(commands) do
		if c.name == "[Mark] Bookmarks of current project" then -- change it to one of the command above
			command = c
		end
	end

	if command then
		command.callback()
	end
end

vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ll", call_bookmark_command)
```

</details>

### BookmarksTree

Check the tree section in the config to find out all the actions you can use.

### Keymap

This plugin doesn't provide any default keybinding. I recommend you to have these four keybindings.

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mm", "<cmd>BookmarksMark<cr>", { desc = "Mark current line into active BookmarkList." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mo", "<cmd>BookmarksGoto<cr>", { desc = "Go to bookmark at current active BookmarkList" })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "ma", "<cmd>BookmarksCommands<cr>", { desc = "Find and trigger a bookmark command." })
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "v" }, "mg", "<cmd>BookmarksGotoRecent<cr>", { desc = "Go to latest visited/created Bookmark" })
```

## CONTRIBUTING

Don't hesitate to ask me anything about the codebase if you want to contribute.

- How to get started:
  1. `plugin/bookmarks.lua` the entry point of the plugin
  2. `lua/bookmarks/domain` where the main objects/concepts live
  3. code layers: user --> `lua/bookmarks/adapter` --> `lua/bookmarks/api` --> `lua/bookmarks/repo` --> json db

## TODO

### V1

- [x] BookmarksMark's input box as a command line. Text start with `!` considered as command.
  - [x] `!newlist [listname]` bookmark current line into a newly created bookmark list and set the list as current active list.
- [x] remove parse commands, prefer BookmarkCommands instead
- [x] `BookmarkCommands` commands picker, a picker allow user to trigger any bookmark command.
- [x] more useful information when dealing with corrupted json db (no issues report yet)
- [x] telescope enhancement (use specific command instead)
- [x] A new command to create bookmark and put it into specific bookmark list (instead current active one)
- [x] Project
  - [x] Add a project field
  - [x] relative path. (project_path/relative_path can make the bookmarks portable, share your bookmarks to another people or your second laptop)
  - [x] bookmarks of current project
  - [x] Hooks: Gotobookmark can trigger function like switch project automatically
- [x] Grep content in files that contains bookmarks

### V2

- [ ] picker
  - [ ] refactor: extract picker module and remove unused modules
  - [ ] get bookmarks in active list --> filter --> sort --> telescope/fzflua
- [ ] filetree-like BookmarkList and Bookmark browsing.
  - [x] MVP thx! @shanlihou
  - [ ] bookmark filter
  - [ ] Add top level bookmark list
  - [ ] sort/modify by bookmark.order field
  - [ ] floating preview window
  - [ ] better default bookmark render format(string format, then better UI)
  - [ ] `u` undo. Expecially for unexpected `d` delete
- [x] ~Recent files as bookmarks: record all the buffer the user recently opened and sort by the visited_at~
  - just use `smart-open.nvim`
- [ ] goto next/prev bookmark in the current buffer
- [ ] smart location calibration according to bookmark content

### V3

- [ ] Sequance diagram out of bookmarks: Pattern `[actor] -->actor sequance_number :: desc`
