# v2.11.0 Release Notes

## Major Changes

### Aider Integration
- Added integration with Aider to manage bookmarked files directly from the tree view.
- New operations include adding files to Aider, adding as read-only, and dropping files from Aider sessions.
- Default key mappings in tree view: `+` for adding, `=` for adding as read-only, and `-` for dropping files.

## Upgrading from v2.10.0
No breaking changes in this release. The new Aider integration and commands are automatically available upon updating. Ensure your configuration includes the latest keybindings or command mappings if you wish to use the new functionalities.
